# Netlfix-Clone
This is a clone based on front-end develpoment created by using just html and css.
This project uses Hyper Text Markup Language for structuring the website and External Cascading Style Sheets for Designing the webpage.

Netflix clone is just an interface of how we can develop a website like netflix, amazon etc.
This project/website would be fully completed and ready to use when all the work on back-end is also completed using mongoDB, expressJS, nodeJS.

## Development Process

- Firstly the logo had to be created so I used cascading style sheets to set the font, colour, background colours and the overall look of the clone from colorhunt.io website.

- Then the next step was to create the various buttons like sign in, get started etc using html and its desinging was done again by using css only, I had to refer to the original netflix page in order to get an idea how the clone should look like.

- The next step was to develop the layout for the page. This involved addition of div tags and adding css to add float the images on the left and right side of the webpage.

- After this I started to develop the FAQ(Frequently Asked Questions) Section using bold css.

- The next step was to create the footer of the page and add necessary links to the pages including Help Center, Jobs, Account and etc. This was done using the unordered list tag which is used in tables(in most cases).

- The final step included the designing of the page so that overall look can be professional.

## Future Work

- I will be adding links to the websites.
- Creating a Login and Sign Up page.
- Adding support for Backend using MERN Stack.
